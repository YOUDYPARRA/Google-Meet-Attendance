# **Update from Al**... in early 2021, the Google Meet Attendance extension was purchased by another organization and I am no longer involved with the project... sorry, I am not allowed to discuss the details any further than that.  

## Support questions should now be sent to support@meet-attendance.com.

Rest assured this was *_not_* an easy decision for me.  I truly appreciate all of the encouragement and support I receieved as this project grew over the past year. Thanks!  Take care and stay safe.
